# Feedforward Neural Network without any ML/DL Library

The code implements a feedforward neural network for binary clasification, with tunable hyperparameters, and without the use of any ML/DL libraries like Tensorflow, PyTorch, SciKit Learn, etc. The code allows for the use of a number of optimizers, like Adam, SGD, GD with Momentum, etc.

This is useful for those looking for the implementation of neural networks at the most basic level, and for those who wish to understand the implementation of the math behind deep neural networks.
